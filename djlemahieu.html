       <p> For 2019 DJ was the undisputed team MVP. He lead the team in WAR, batting average, runs, and RBIs. He set a personal season record for homeruns with 26. This is surprising because he is 31 years and typically you see players starting to regress once they hit their early to mid-thirties. After signing with the Yankees in the previous offseason DJ was supposed to be a backup player with his infield versatility, but he produced early in the season and won a starting job. The most notable statistic of his is that he led the MLB in batting average with runners in scoring postion at .389 meaning he was one of the most clutch hitters in the MLB this season</p>
