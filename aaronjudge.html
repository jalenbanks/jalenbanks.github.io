       <p> Aaron Judge is the heart, soul, and unofficial captain of the New York Yankees. Although his numbers may look low this is because of an oblique injury he suffered that took away about 40% of his season. In just 102 games Judge managed hit hit 27 homeruns and drive in 55 RBIs. Over a 162 game season he would have hit around 40 homeruns and 90 RBIs based on his pace. Not only is Judge scary at the plate, he is one of the best OF in the league, leading the MLB in defensive runs saved because of how strong his arm is and how quick he is tracking down fly balls.   </p>
